            <h2>Kieler Woche</h2>
            <p>I was involved with programming for Kieler Woche, an annual sailing festival in Kiel, SH. The Institute f√ºr Geowissenschaft had a tent, for which I was responsible for generating the educational programming. I created two activities, a microscope activity and an interactive build-your-own core, bringing geosciences outreach to school groups from the surrounding area. The outreach stand ran from Tuesday - Thursday, and programming was available in both German and English.</p>
